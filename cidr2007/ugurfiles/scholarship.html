<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">CIDR Graduate Student Scholarship Program</span></big><br>
<br>
Thanks to generous donations from our sponsors, CIDR will offer a
limited number of grants for students who would like to attend CIDR'07.
The grant is exclusively available to graduate students and will only
cover the registration fee (for a shared room).<br>
<br>
Applications should include the following material:<br>
- a brief research statement from the student<br>
- a brief note from the student's advisor endorsing the application<br>
<br>
This material should be sent via e-mail to stonebraker@csail.mit.edu.
The subject of the e-mails should read "CIDR'07 &lt;student's
lastname&gt;". The e-mails should be in plain text and should not
include any attachments.<br>
<br>
Priority will be given to students who are co-authors on accepted papers and demos.<br>
