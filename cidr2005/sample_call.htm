<P align=center>CIDR: First Semiannual Conference on Innovative Data Systems 
Research</P>
<P align=center>Asilomar, CA.</P>
<P align=center>January 5-9, 2003</P><FONT size=2><B>
<P>Purpose:</B> CIDR offers a venue for the presentation of on innovative data 
systems architectures, as well as a prestigious publication opportunity. Such 
papers are typically speculative or are system evaluations. The visionary papers 
usually lack rigorous frameworks, simulations of performance, or prototype 
implementations. The prototype descriptions generally are a detailed report on 
successes and mistakes. There is no venue among the major DBMS conferences for 
papers on such work. Traditional conferences usually reject such submissions. 
However, these are often the very papers that offer long term value to the 
field, and should be widely disseminated. CIDR will not compete with the 
established conferences presenting rigorous treatises in established areas; 
rather its goal is to air radically new ideas.</P>
<P>The conference will be single-tracked. Proceedings will be published both as 
a website and in book form. The conference will run every-other year, typically 
in the fall or winter during non-HTPS years.</P><B>
<P>Scope:</B> Papers are invited on innovative and visionary approaches to data 
systems architecture. Topics of interest include database systems, application 
servers, messaging systems, workflow, ETL, warehousing, data mining, small-scale 
and large-scale systems, portal systems, and architectures that are particularly 
manageable or available or scaleable. Especially encouraged are architectures 
for new application areas, and innovative data and system integration solutions. 
Also encouraged are papers on innovative uses of DBMS and middleware technology. 
Lastly, "war stories" on overcoming common problems are welcome.</P><B>
<P>Organization</B>: This conference is organized by the Committee on Innovative 
Data Systems Research (CIDR), composed of the 22 people listed below. The plan 
is to make CIDR a continuing organization with rotating committee members. CIDR 
will request (but does not require) co-sponsorship from ACM SIGMOD. Funding 
support for the conference is provided by the individual members of CIDR.</P><B>
<P>Papers:</B> Submissions should not exceed 10,000 words; extended background 
and demos may be augmented by a website that will become part of the submission. 
Submissions should be sent in camera-ready form to the chairman of the program 
committee, Mike Stonebraker (stonebraker@lcs.mit.edu.) Each submission will be 
reviewed by at least three members of the organizing committee. To encourage 
only the best work, each person can be an author or co-author on only one 
submission. With a similar purpose in mind, each organizing committee member has 
agreed to submit her best work for consideration. </P><B>
<P>Dates</B>: Submissions are due by August 1, 2002. Authors will be notified of 
acceptance by October 1, 2002. Final versions are due December 1, 2002. Further 
information can be obtained from the program chairman.</P>
