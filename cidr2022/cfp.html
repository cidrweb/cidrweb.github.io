<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
The annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference, complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR gathers researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field.
	<p>
We invite contributions on novel approaches to data management systems, architecture, and usage. CIDR encourages contributions about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insight, resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. CIDR especially values innovation, experience-based insight, and vision.

	<p>
	This year, CIDR invites three kinds of contributions: (a) papers (at most 6 pages). We invite both regular research papers and more visionary papers that promote interesting ideas and ongoing work. To encourage authors to submit only their best work, each person can be an author or co-author of at most two submissions in total of kind a) and b). (b) demos (a video or a description of the demo in at most 6 pages). Authors who feel their work is best captured through a demo should submit a demo proposal. Demos and papers will be interweaved in a single-tracked program. (c) abstracts (at most 1 page). If you have an idea that is too half-baked for a paper or demo proposal, you may submit an abstract. Any author of a paper or demo may additionally submit one abstract. Abstracts are expected to have a single author. Abstracts will be presented in a poster session.
	<p>
Abstracts, papers and demos will be reviewed by the program committee, who will select the final program in co-operation with the organizing committee.

	<p>
	The number of participants at CIDR is limited to allow an intimate single-track experience. In the past, CIDR reached maximum capacity several weeks before the conference. As in the past, registration for the 2022 conference will be carried out in two phases. Authors who submitted an abstract or co-authored a paper or demo submission are invited to register before October 22th (independent of acceptance). After October 22th, registration is on a first-come-first-serve basis until the conference capacity is reached. So, if you plan to attend the conference, please, submit at least an abstract.

<p>


	<h3>SUBMISSIONS</h3>
	<p>
<h3>Regular Submissions</h3>
<p>
	<b>Papers should be electronically submitted in pdf
format to <a
href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CIDR2022">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CIDR2022</a>.
	</b>
	<p>
Topics of interest include but are not limited to: database systems, storage management, transaction processing, cloud computing, massive data analysis, software service infrastructure, scalability and dependability, embedded and sensor databases, user interfaces, information integration and data cleaning architectures, information retrieval, declarative systems, data management in networks, benchmarking and experimental methodology, and databases for ML and ML for databases. We also welcome submissions on thought-provoking applications and emerging uses of data management technology.
	<p> 
		Submissions are single-blind and must be
		formatted using the ACM SIG style. (see  <a
		href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM
		Template</a>), and must not exceed SIX pages including references (for papers
		and demos) and ONE page (for abstracts) in length.
		Videos can be submitted in HTML or MPEG format. Submissions will be reviewed by the program
		committee which will make acceptance and rejection
		decisions. Final versions of accepted submissions will be
		published in the electronic proceedings of the CIDR
		conference. The final versions of accepted papers and demos
		have no page limit and can be significantly expanded
		from the submitted form. At least one author of an
		accepted paper or demo will be expected to attend the
		conference in order to present the paper. For
		accepted papers and demos with several co-authors,
		the program committee reserves the right to select
		the co-author who should present the paper at the
		conference as a condition of acceptance.
	<p>
		Abstracts will be published on the CIDR 2022 web page (provided the
		author agrees). Authors of selected abstracts will be invited
		to give a 5-minute presentation at the
		conference.

<h3>Camera Ready Guidelines</h3>
<p>
Camera-ready papers need to follow the formatting instructions above. Additionally, they need to include the following copyright notice at the bottom left of the first page. This <a href="cidr-2022.cls" download> latex style file</a> and this <a href="pubform-CIDR2022.docx" download> Word template file </a> include the copyright notice. We recommend that you use it, which will display the following information:
<p>
<i>This article is published under a Creative Commons Attribution License(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits distribution and reproduction in any medium as well as allowing derivative works, provided that you attribute the original work to the author(s) and CIDR 2022. 12th Annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR â€™22). January 9-12, 2022, Chaminade, USA.</i>


<h3>Video Submissions</h3>
<p>
While CIDR2022 will use live talks (15 minutes presentation + 5 minutes discussion for regular papers, and 4 minutes presentation + 1 minute discussion for abstracts) either given in-person or through zoom, we *additionally* request authors to submit a pre-recorded version of this talk. In case of regular talks, that version should be a bit shorter (or delivered faster..), and fit 12 minutes max. We will publish these talks on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMSoRpgXRxhiSna6FkhTGeg/videos">YouTube channel of cidrdb</a>.
<p>
These videos need to be submitted with the camera-ready through CMT in the mp4 format, though the videos can be submitted later than the camera-ready. Authors have been emailed about this. 
<p>
Please record your talk with Zoom, and while doing so, please use as your video background this image: <a href="img/cidr2022-background.png">cidr2022-background.png</a>
