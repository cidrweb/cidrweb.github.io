<p>Applying Model Management to Classical Meta Data Problems </p><p>Phillip A. Bernstein, Microsoft Research</p><p>Model Management is a new approach to meta data management that offers a higher   level programming interface. Its goal is to greatly improve programmer productivity   for meta data driven applications over object-at-a-time and classical database-style   languages, such as SQL, OQL, or XQuery. The main abstractions are models (e.g.,   SQL or XML schemas, ER models) and mappings between models (e.g. XML to XML,   ER to SQL). It treats models and mappings as bulk objects, and offers such operators   as Match, Merge, Diff, Compose, Apply, Copy, ModelGen, and Enumerate. This paper   summarizes and extends earlier treatments of these operators and applies them   to three classical meta data management problems: schema integration, schema   evolution, and round-trip engineering. The latter offers the first detailed   demonstration that model management can be used to solve a wide range of meta   data problems. </p>
