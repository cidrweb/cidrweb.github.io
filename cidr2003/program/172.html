<p>Distributed Query Processing and Catalogs for Peer-to-Peer Systems</p><p> Vassilis Papadimos, David Maier, Kristin Tufte, OGI/OHSU</p><p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures are commonly used for file-sharing applications.   The reasons for P2P's popularity in file sharing – fault tolerance, scalability,   and ease of deployment also make it a good model for distributed data management.   In this paper, we introduce a scalable P2P framework for distributed data management   applications using mutant query plans: XML serializations of algebraic query   plan graphs that can include verbatim XML data, references to resource locations   (URLs), and abstract resource names (URNs). We show how we can build distributed   catalogs based on hierarchical namespaces that can efficiently handle content   indexing and query routing. We also discuss how peers can convey the currency   and coverage of their data, and how queries can use this information to manage   the inherent tradeoffs between answer completeness, timeliness, and latency. </p>
