<p>Enter Once, Share Everywhere: User Profile Management in Converged Networks </p><p>Arnaud Sahuguet, Rick Hull, Daniel Lieuwen, Ming Xiong, Bell Labs</p><p>Interoperation between network types (telephony, wireless, internet, etc.)   is becoming increasingly feasible, leading to the so-called ``converged network",   and to a broad new family of end-user focused ``converged services", that combine   different kinds of network connectivity (voice, text-based instant and email   messaging, real-time presence and location information, and access to numerous   web-based services). A crucial but still largely unresolved issue in providing   convenient end-user access to and control of these services is to provide easy   access and sharing of end-user profile data, including data about the user's   devices, services enabled, billing arrangements, address, calendar and preferences.   This paper surveys the kinds of profile data that are currently held in the   various networks and where/how that data is stored, identifies key standards   group activities working to enable profile data sharing, and proposes a data   management framework (GUPster) that can be used across and within networks and   organizations, to facilitate sharing of profile data to support converged services.   GUPster combines ideas from the federated architecture for data integration   and the Napster approach for peer-to-peer sharing, in order to satisfy the high   level requirements coming from standards bodies such as 3GPP GUP and the Liberty   Alliance. The paper describes how the GUPster framework can be supported, and   identifies key topics for future research. </p>
