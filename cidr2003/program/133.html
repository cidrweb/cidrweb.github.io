<p>Towards High Performance Peer-to-Peer Content and Resource Sharing Systems </p><p>Peter Triantafillou, Chryssani Xiruhaki, Manolis Koubarakis, Nikolaos Ntarmos</p><p> Peer-to-peer sharing systems are becoming increasingly popular and an exciting   new class of innovative, internet-based data management systems. In these systems,   users contribute their own resources (processing units and storage devices)   and content (i.e., documents) to the P2P community. We focus on the management   of content and resources in such systems. Our goal is to harness all available   resources in the P2P network so that the users can access all available content   efficiently. Efficiency is taken both from (i) the point of view of the system,   in that we strive to ensure fair load distribution among all peer nodes, and   (ii) from the point of view of the users, in that we strive to ensure low user-request   response times. We propose a novel architecture for this new class of applications,   which differs drastically from what is either found currently in existing products   or proposed in academia. We contribute and study novel solutions that achieve   our goals, while at the same time addressing the formidable challenges due to   the autonomy of peers, their heterogeneous processing and storage capacities,   their different content contributions, the huge system scale, and the highly   dynamic system environment. </p>
