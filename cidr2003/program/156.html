<p>Speculative Query Processing </p><p>Neoklis Polyzotis, Yannis Ioannidis </p><p>Speculation is an every day phenomenon whereby one acts in anticipation of   particular conditions that are likely to hold in the future. Computer science   research has seen many successfull applications of speculation: modern processors,   for example, speculate on the run-time properties of a program and decide to   pre-execute instructions accordingly. We draw inspiration from these techniques   and introduce speculation to query processing. Our approach is based on a visual   query interface that monitors the construction of a query and takes advantage   of the user `think time'. In particular, based on the features of the partial   query specified at any point, the interface prepares the database by issuing   asynchronous manipulations to it that are likely to make the final query (or   even queries further into the future) more efficient. Furthermore, the interface   applies machine learning techniques on past user actions and builds a user-behavior   model that guides speculation and deals with future uncertainty. We formalize   speculative query processing as an optimization problem and derive algebraic   properties of the corresponding cost model that are sufficient to address the   complexities of the particular optimization. We have implemented our framework   on top of an existing commercial database system and have evaluated its effectiveness   experimentally, with actual user traces. Our results show that speculation outperforms   normal query processing, reducing query execution time by an average of 35%   and achieving performance improvements of more than 90% on certain queries. </p>
