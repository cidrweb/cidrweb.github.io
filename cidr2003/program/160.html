<p>XL: a platform for Web Services </p><p>Daniela Florescu (XQRL, Inc.), Andreas Gruenhagen (TU Muenchen),<br>  Donald Kossmann (TU Muenchen and XQRL, Inc.)</p><p>This paper presents XL, a new platform for Web services. The XL project has   three main goals: (a) Increase the productivity of application developers. For   this purpose, XL provides high-level programming constructs for routine tasks   (authorization, logging, error handling, etc.) and lets programmers concentrate   specifically on the application logic. (b) Compliance with all W3C standards   (e.g., XML, SOAP, WSDL); as a result, XL Web services can interact with other   Web services written in, say, Java or C\#. (c) Scalability, security, and high   availability; the platform runs on a cluster of servers, it is supposed to work   with a variety of different database products, and within the platform all optimizations   are done automatically. We hope to achieve these objectives by providing a very   rich programming model which is based on a very simple core algebra. This core   algebra is based on an extension of Milner's PI-calculus (see Milner). To optimize   programs (i.e., expressions of this core algebra), we employ techniques from   the design of database systems, compiler construction, and data flow machines.   This paper presents the initial design of the XL programming model and its implementation.   A demo of the platform has been shown in Sigmod 202. </p>
