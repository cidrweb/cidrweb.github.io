<p>The Virtual Data Grid: A New Model and Architecture for Data-Intensive Collaboration </p><p>Ian Foster, Jens Voeckler, Michael Wilde, Yong Zhao </p><p>It is increasingly common to encounter communities engaged in the collaborative   analysis and transformation of large quantities of data over extended periods   of time. We argue that these communities require a scalable system for managing,   tracing, exploring and communicating the derivation and analysis of diverse   data objects. Such a system could bring significant productivity increases facilitating   discovery, understanding, assessment, and sharing of both data and transformation   resources, as well as facilitating the productive use of distributed resources   for computation, storage, and collaboration. Thus, we define a model and architecture   for a virtual data grid capable of addressing this requirement. We define a   broadly applicable model of a “typed dataset” as the unit of derivation tracking,   and simple constructs for describing how datasets are derived from transformations   and from other datasets. We also define mechanisms for integrating with, and   adapting to, existing data management systems and transformation and analysis   tools, as well as Grid mechanisms for distributed resource management and computation   planning. We report on successful application results obtained with a prototype   implementation called Chimera, involving challenging analyses of high-energy   physics and astronomy data </p>
