<p>SkyQuery: A Web Service Approach to Federate Database </p><p>Stanu Malik, Alex Szalay </p><p>An evolving federation of heterogeneous, autnomoud databases require a simple,   flexbile and efficient medium fo interoperability, to handle its distribbuted   computing tasks. An incorrect choice of interoperability standards may make   the system unweildy and expensive, resulting in a defunct federation. Finally,   some applications require complex distributed computing tasks over Internet.   One of such applications is astronomy archives which are stored on heterogeneous   systems spread across the world. A federation provides them the glue to evaluate   complex distributed spatial queries on component databases that are often extremely   heterogeneous. We present SkyQuery, a successful prototype of such a federation,   which is based on the emerging Web Services distributed computing model. This   model works efficiently over Internet. We describe the SkyQuery architecture   and show how it efficiently evaluates a probabilistic spatial join query called   the cross match query. </p>
