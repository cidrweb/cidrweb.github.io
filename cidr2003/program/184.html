<p>Active Server Availability Feedback </p><p>James Hamilton, Microsoft</p><p>The current software development process in common use within industry is inefficient   in that the time required to incorporate results from previous releases, beta   releases, and competitive releases into new software available to customers   is typically measured in years.&nbsp; Further, the accuracy of customer feedback   gathered by the development team is frequently weak or incomplete, with samples   often drawn from only a tiny, self-selected set of customers.&nbsp; This talk   argues that we can use software to automate this feedback process and, in so   doing, drive an order of magnitude improvement in the rate at which software   evolves and improves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We present two active server feedback systems in this paper, the first, a system   just recently deployed in full scale production use, and a second a&nbsp; research   system that has been deployed on a nine month, 100+ production server deployment.&nbsp;   The architectures of both systems is described, early results are presented,   and future plans discussed.</p>
