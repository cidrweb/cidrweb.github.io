<p>Genomics Algebra: A New, Integrating Data Model, Language, and Tool for Processing   and Querying Genomic Information </p><p>Joachim Hammer, Markus Schneider </p><p>The dramatic increase of mostly semi-structured genomic data, their heterogeneity   and high variety, and the increasing complexity of biological applications and   methods mean that many and very important challenges in biology are now challenges   in computing and here especially in databases. In contrast to the many query-driven   approaches advocated in the literature, we propose a new integrating approach   that is based on two fundamental pillars. The Genomics Algebra provides an extensible   set of high-level genomic data types (GDTs) (e.g., genome, gene, chromosome,   protein, nucleotide) together with a comprehensive collection of appropriate   genomic functions (e.g., translate, transcribe, decode). The Unifying Database   allows us to manage the semi-structured or, ideally, structured contents of   publicly available genomic repositories and to transfer these data into GDT   values. These values then serve as arguments of Genomics Algebra operations,   which can be embedded into a DBMS query language. </p>
