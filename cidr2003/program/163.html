<p>Scalable Distributed Stream Processing<br></p><p>Mitch Cherniack (Brandeis University), Hari Balakrishnan, Magdalena Balazinska   (M.I.T.), Don Carney, Ugur Cetintemel, Ying Xing, and Stan Zdonik (Brown University)</p><p>Stream processing fits a large class of new applications for which conventional   DBMSs fall short. Recently, a number of proposals for stream processing systems   have emerged. One such system is Aurora, currently under development at Brown   University, M.I.T., and Brandeis University. Many of the environments that produce   streams are, by nature, highly distributed. Thus, effective stream processing   systems must integrate well into distributed environments. This paper discusses   the architectural and operational issues we have confronted in the design of   the distributed version of Aurora: Aurora*. </p>
