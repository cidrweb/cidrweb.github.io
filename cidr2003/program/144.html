<p>The BINGO! System for Information Portal Generation and Expert Web Search</p><p>Serge Sizov, Martin Theobald, Stefan Siersdorfer, Gerhard Weikum, Jens Graupmann,   Michael Biwer, Patrick Zimmer </p><p>This paper presents the BINGO! focused crawler, an advanced tool for information   portal generation and expert Web search. In contrast to standard search engines   such as Google which are solely based on precomputed index structures, a focused   crawler interleaves crawling, automatic classification, link analysis and assessment,   and text filtering. A crawl is started from a user-provided set of training   data and aims to collect comprehensive results for the given topics. The focused   crawling paradigm has been around for a few years and many of our techniques   are adopted from the information retrieval and machine learning literature.   BINGO! is a system-oriented effort to integrate a suite of techniques into a   comprehensive and versatile tool. The paper discusses its overall architecture   and main components, important lessons from early experimentation and the resulting   improvements on effectiveness and efficiency, and experimental results that   demonstrate the usefulness of BINGO! as a next-generation tool for information   organization and search. </p>
