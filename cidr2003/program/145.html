<p>Crossing the Structure Chasm </p><p>Alon Halevy, Oren Etzioni, Anhai Doan, Zachary Ives, Jayant Madhavan, Luke   McDowell, Igor Tatarinov, University of Washingon</p><p>It has been observed on many occasions that the majority of the world's data   lies outside database systems. The reason is that database systems focus on   structured data, leaving the unstructured realm to others. The world of unstructured   data has several very appealing properties, such as ease of authoring, querying   and data sharing. In comparison, authoring, querying and sharing structured   data require significant effort, albeit with the benefit of rich query languages   and exact answers. We argue that in order to broaden the use of data management   tools, we need a concerted effort to cross this structure chasm. By this, we   mean importing the attractive properties of the unstructured world into the   structured one. As a case study, we introduce the Revere System, which attempts   to cross the chasm on the WWW. The goal of Revere is to create a web of structured   data from data that is usually stored in HTML web pages (e.g., personal information,   course information, etc.). Revere offers three innovations. First, it provides   a set of tools that entices people to structure data and enables them to do   it rapidly. Second, it provides a data sharing environment, based on a peer-data   management system, in which a web of data is created by establishing local mappings   between schemas, and query answering is done over the transitive closure of   these mappings. Third, Revere adapts the main technique of the unstructured   world, namely statistics over text corpora, for the structured world. We sketch   tools for assisting in schema creation and mapping that are based on collecting   statistics from large corpora of structures. These statistics describe how terms   tend to be used in structures. </p>
