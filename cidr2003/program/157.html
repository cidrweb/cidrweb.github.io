<p>A Case for Staged Database </p><p>Systems Stavros Harizopoulos, Anastassia Ailamaki, Carnegie Mellon University</p><p>Traditional database system architectures face a rapidly evolving operating   environment where millions of users store and access terabytes of data. In order   to cope with increasing demands for performance high-end DBMS employ parallel   processing techniques coupled with a plethora of sophisticated features. However,   the widely adopted work-centric thread-parallel execution model entails several   shortcomings that limit server performance when executing workloads with changing   requirements. Moreover, the monolithic approach in DBMS software has lead to   complex designs which are difficult to extend. This paper introduces a staged   design for high-performance, evolvable DBMS that are easy to tune and maintain.   We propose to break the database system into modules and to encapsulate them   into self-contained stages connected to each other through queues. The staged,   data-centric design remedies the weaknesses of modern DBMS by providing solutions   at both a hardware and a software engineering level. </p>
