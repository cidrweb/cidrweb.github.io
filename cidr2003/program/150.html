<p>Approximate Range Selection Queries in Peer-to-Peer Systems </p><p>Abhishek Gupta, Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi </p><p>We present an architecture for a data sharing peer-to-peer system where the   data is shared in the form of database relations. In general, peer-to-peer systems   try to locate exact-match data objects to simple user queries. Since peer-to-peer   users generally tend to submit broad queries in order to find data of their   interest, we develop a P2P data sharing architecture for computing approximate   answers for the complex queries by finding data ranges that are similar to the   user query. Thus this paper represents the first step towards solving the general   range lookup problem over P2P systems instead of exact lookup operations. </p>
