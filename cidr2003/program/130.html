<p>Capacity Bound-free Web Warehouse </p><p>Yahiko Kambayashi, Kai Cheng, Kyoto University</p><p>Limited storage capacity is a critical assumption in conventional cache management.   Most cache management algorithms are developed under this assumption. However,   in the web context, disk-resident caches can be so large that constraints on   storage capacity become no longer essential. Although caches of very large capacity,   such as those in CDNs, maintain a large amount of web data, they are not made   full use due to the lack of data management capabilities as realized in a database   system. In this paper, we propose Capacity Bound-free Web Warehouse (CBWW),   a sophisticated data manager for caches without storage limitation. In this   work, a cache, enhanced with data modeling and querying capabilities, is viewed   as a combination of data base and data stream. Our approach is based on and   derive its advantages from a semantic model of web data. Based on this model,   we develop content--sensitive cache management strategies. We also demonstrate   that this model also enables cache--conscious web navigation as well as history-aware   queries to cached contents. </p>
