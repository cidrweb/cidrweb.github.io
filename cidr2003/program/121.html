<p>Architectural Issues and Solutions in the Development of Data-Intensive Web   Applications </p><p>Stefano Ceri, Piero Fraternali, Aldo Bongio, Stefano Butti, Roberto Acerbis,   Marco Tagliasacchi, Giovanni Toffetti, Carlo Conserva, Roberto Elli, Fulvio   Ciapessoni, Claudio Greppi </p><p>A data-intensive Web application is a Web-enabled software system for the publication   and management of large data collections, typically stored in one or more database   management systems. Data-intensive Web applications constitute the most diffused   class of applications found on the Web today, and their industrial relevance   is an established fact. As a consequence, an intense technical and scientific   debate is ongoing on the various aspects of their implementation, especially   on the software architectures and design process best suited to cope with the   peculiar aspects of a data-intensive Web application. The ideal software process   should meet two possibly competing goals: 1) capturing the application requirements   in a formal way, so to incorporate them in the development lifecycle and derive   the software directly from the functional requirements; 2) delivering a software   architecture that meets the non-functional requirements of performance, security,   scalability, and availability, and maintainability. Such process should also   be amenable to automation, to let developers concentrate on functional requirements   and optimization, and delegate the repetitive tasks to software tools. The goal   of this paper is to report on an experience of applying a novel software development   process to data-intensive Web applications, and to discuss the problems, design   choices, and trade-offs that led to the conception of WebRatio, an innovative   technology for Web application development. </p>
