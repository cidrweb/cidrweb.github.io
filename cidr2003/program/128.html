<p>Sorting And Indexing With Partitioned B-Trees</p><p>Goetz Graefe, Microsoft</p><p>Partitioning within a B-tree, based on an artificial leading key column and   combined with online reorganization, can be exploited during external merge   sort for accurate deep read-ahead and dynamic resource allocation, during index   creation for a reduced delay until the first query can search the new index,   during data loading for streaming integration of new data into a fully indexed   database, and for miscellaneous other operations. While some of the ideas discussed   here have been touched upon elsewhere, the focus here is on re-thinking the   relationship between sorting and B-trees more thoroughly, on exploiting this   relationship to simplify and unify data structures and algorithms, and on gathering   comprehensive lists of issues and benefits.</p>
