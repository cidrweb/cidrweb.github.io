<p>AIMS: An Immersidata Management System </p><p>Cyrus Shahabi </p><p>We introduce a system to address the challenges involved in managing the multidimensional   sensor data streams generated within immersive environments. We call this data   type, {\em immersidata}, which is defined as the data acquired from a user's   interactions with an immersive environment. Management of immersidata is challenging   because they are: 1) multidimensional, 2) spatio-temporal, 3) continuous data   streams (CDS), 4) potentially large in size and bandwidth requirements, and   5) noisy. By focusing on two specific applications, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity   Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis and American Sign Language (ASL) recognition, we propose   to study the challenges of two main modes of operations on immersidata: off-line   and online query and analysis. In addition, we propose complementary approaches   for efficient acquisition and storage of immersidata. The core promising idea   behind our proposed approaches is a {\em `database friendly'} utilization of   linear algebraic transformations on both data sets and queries to efficiently   abstract, aggregate, classify and/or approximate multidimensional data streams. </p>
