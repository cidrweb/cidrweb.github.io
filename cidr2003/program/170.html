<p>TelegraphCQ: Continuous Dataflow Processing for an Uncertain World </p><p>Sirish Chandrasekaran, Amol Deshpande, Mike Franklin, Joseph Hellerstein, Wei   Hong, Sailesh Krishnamurthy, Sam Madden, Vijayshankar Raman, Fred Reiss, Mehul   Shah </p><p>Increasingly pervasive networks are leading towards a world where data is constantly   in motion. In such a world, conventional techniques for query processing, which   were developed under the assumption of a far more static and predictable computational   environment, will not be sufficient. Instead, query processors, based on the   idea of adaptive dataflow will be necessary. The Telegraph project has developed   a suite of novel technologies for implementing continuously adaptive query processing.   The next generation Telegraph system, called TelegraphCQ is focused on meeting   the challenges that arise in handling large streams of continuous queries over   high-volume, highly-variable data streams. TelegraphCQ differs from other data   stream and CQ projects due to its focus on extreme adaptivity and the novel   infrastructure required to support such adaptivity. In this paper, we describe   both the system architecture and its underlying technology. We also report on   an experiment on an early proof-of-concept implementation and discuss our research   agenda. </p>
