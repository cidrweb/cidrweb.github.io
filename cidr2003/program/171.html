<p>Distributed Computing with BEA WebLogic Server </p><p>Dean Jacobs, BEA</p><p>This paper surveys distributed computing techniques used in the implementation   of BEA WebLogic Server. It discusses how multi-tier cluster architectures for   application servers are influenced by two significant requirements: (i) supporting   a workload consisting of many short-running requests and (ii) providing a transactional   infrastructure that extends beyond the boundaries of backing databases. These   requirements also apply to TP Monitors, and this paper identifies ways in which   WebLogic Server was influenced by, and differs from, BEA Tuxedo. Drawing upon   experiences with BEA WebLogic Workshop, it then discusses ways in which the   basic application server infrastructure needs to be enhanced to support Web   Services. Finally, this paper speculates about enterprise computing architectures   that are amenable to wider forms of distribution. </p>
