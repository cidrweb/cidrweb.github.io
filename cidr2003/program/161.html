<p>Query Processing in Sensor Networks </p><p>Yong Yao, Johannes Gehrke </p><p>Hardware for sensor nodes that combine physical sensors, actuators, embedded   processors, and communication components, has advanced significantly over the   last decade, and made the large-scale deployments of such sensors a reality.   Applications range from typical monitoring applications such as inventory maintenance   over health care to military applications. In the Cornell Cougar System, we   are developing a {\em query layer} for sensor networks. The query layer accepts   queries in a declarative language, that are then optimized to generate efficient   query execution plans with in-network processing which can significantly reduce   resource requirements. In this vision paper, we examine the main architectural   components of such a query layer, concentrating on in-network aggregation, interaction   of query processing with the wireless routing protocol, and distributed query   processing. Initial simulation experiments with the NS-2 network simulator show   the tradeoffs of our system. </p>
