<p>Managing Expressions as Data in Relational Database Systems </p><p>Aravind Yalamanchi, Jagannathan Srinivasan, Dieter Gawlick, Oracle Corporation</p><p>A wide-range of applications, including Publish/Subscribe, Workflow, and Web-site   Personalization, require maintaining user’s interest in expected data as conditional   expressions. This paper proposes to manage such expressions as data in Relational   Database Systems (RDBMS). This is accomplished 1) by allowing expressions to   be stored in a column of a database table and 2) by introducing a SQL EVALUATE   operator to evaluate expressions for given data. Expressions when combined with   predicates on other forms of data in a database, are just a flexible and powerful   way of expressing interest in a data item. The ability to evaluate expressions   (via EVALUATE operator) in SQL, enables applications to take advantage of the   expressive power of SQL to support complex subscription models. The paper describes   the key concepts, presents our approach of managing expressions in Oracle RDBMS,   discusses a novel indexing scheme that allows efficient filtering of a large   set of expressions, and outlines future directions. </p>
