<p>Query Processing, Approximation, and Resource Management in a Data Stream Management   System </p><p>Rajeev Motwani, Jennifer Widom, Arvind Arasu, Brian Babcock, Shivnath Babu,   Mayur Datar, Gurmeet Manku, Chris Olston, Justin Rosenstein, Rohit Varma, Stanford   University </p><p>This paper describes our ongoing work developing the Stanford Stream Data Manager   (STREAM), a system for executing continuous queries over multiple continuous   data streams. The STREAM system supports a declarative query language, and it   copes with high data rates and query workloads by providing approximate answers   when resources are limited. This paper describes specific contributions made   so far and enumerates our next steps in developing a general-purpose Data Stream   Management System. </p>
