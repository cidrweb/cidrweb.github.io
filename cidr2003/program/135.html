<p>The Database Machine: Old Story, New Slant? </p><p>Julie A. McCann </p><p>Current database management system technology is unable to provide adequate   support for what has been deemed the 3rd wave of computing -- Ubiquitous Computing.   Such applications require systems that are sufficiently lightweight and customisable   to provide high performance while consuming minimal power, yet extensible enough   to adapt to a constantly changing environment. Current DBMS architectures do   not provide this level of customisation or adaptability. Therefore we suggest   an alternative where database systems shake off their relatively monolithic   structure and become open sets of fine-grained components providing a collection   of key information provision services and have the ability to adapt. This paper   explores the motivation for componentisation and how modern operating systems   research can influence the DBMS architecture. If components are the answer,   then are we announcing the end of database management systems as we currently   know them, or are we just describing a database machine for the 21st century? </p>
